# Bugs/Minor Updates

Below is a list of issues that should be investigated and resolved -
1. When dueling I believe there is a misspelling. I saw the word "Dual" in the title instead of Duel (as in fighting)
2. If bosses or super bosses are not yet killed and time is about to run out, let's say 1 or 2 hours before the time ends
we should auto-post a message that is like a call to arms to all the heroes of Nilfheim to fight the boss before it's
too late. Something like, 

"Time is almost up, where are the heroes? <show the boss/super boss stats and current progression>"
"Calling all heroes of Nilfheim, the world needs you. <show the boss/super boss stats and current progression>"

We don't have to use these exact words and messaging. Let's do something that makes sense. Come up with atleast 3-5
variations to mix things up that can be chosen at random. The point is, just in case players missed the initial spawn
of the boss or super boss is a good way to remind them that the boss is still alive and well and that they should act
before the time is up.

# TASKS_19: Project Completion Summary

## Objective

Create a comprehensive project completion summary documenting the final state of the MIKROS Discord Bot project,
including:

1. **Project Completion Report** - Summary of all completed tasks
2. **Feature Inventory** - Complete list of implemented features
3. **API Integration Status** - What's implemented vs. what needs backend
4. **Deployment Readiness Checklist** - Final verification before production
5. **Known Limitations** - What's not yet implemented (by design)
6. **Future Roadmap** - Suggested next steps

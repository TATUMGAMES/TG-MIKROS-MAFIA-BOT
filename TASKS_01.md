# Ideas

**class-exclusive world interactions** - the cleanest, most RPG-authentic way to balance without touching numbers.

## 1. Design Rules for Class-Exclusive Exploration Events

These rules keep this fair and magical:

**Rule 1 — Rare (1–2%)**

* These should feel like “wait… what just happened?”
* Not part of daily farming loops

**Rule 2 — Exclusive Outcome, Shared Discovery**

* Everyone can *find* the event
* Only the right class can *resolve* it fully

**Rule 3 — Never Hard-Block Progress**

* Non-matching classes get:

  * Flavor
  * Minor consolation XP
  * A reason to bring others next time

**Rule 4 — Identity Over Power**

* Rewards are:

  * Unique items
  * Story flags
  * Small bonuses
* Not raw XP spikes

---

## 2. Core System: “Rare Exploration Events”

When exploring:

* **Base chance:** 1%
* If triggered → roll on **Class-Sensitive Event Table**

Narrative always reveals *what it is* before the outcome.

> “Beneath the frost-covered rubble, you uncover something unusual…”

---

## 3. Class-Exclusive Exploration Events (Plug-and-Play)

### 🗡️ Rogue — *The Opportunist*

#### 🔐 Locked Chest (Rogue-Exclusive Resolution)

**Discovery:** Anyone
**Resolution:** Rogue only

* Rogue outcome:

  * Extra essences
  * Chance for catalyst
  * Possible rare cosmetic trinket

* Non-Rogue outcome:

  * Can’t open it
  * Gains small XP + story note

  > “If only someone more… dexterous were here.”

This alone will:

* Make Rogues socially valuable
* Encourage grouping & reputation

---

* Passage collapses

---

#### 🕊️ Lost Pilgrim

---

## 4. Safeguards (Very Important)

To avoid “wrong class feels bad”:

* Non-matching classes **always get something**
* Never remove items or XP
* No event blocks crafting materials entirely
* No death or heavy HP loss from these events

Think:

> “Oh cool — next time I hope a Rogue finds this.”

Not:

> “I wasted a charge.”

---

## 5. How This Fixes Class Balance (Quietly)

After this:

* Rogues are *treasure specialists*
* Warriors are *path breakers*
* Knights are *guardians*
* Mages are *knowledge gates*
* Necromancers are *memory keepers*
* Priests are *restorers*

Suddenly:

* Priest/Necro aren’t “overpowered”
* They’re just *special in different situations*

That’s ideal balance.
